1. Project Design Framework
Replace "timeline" with milestone-driven structure, specifying:

3 phases with 2-3 milestones per phase (e.g., Phase 1: Research Proposal Approval by Q1 2024)
Quantifiable KPIs (e.g., 80% data validation for Milestone 2)
Gantt chart integration for real-time progress tracking
2. User Portfolio Dashboard
Post-successful fundraising:

Enable researchers to upload datasets, peer reviews, and milestone evidence via dynamic portfolio templates
Implement milestone-triggered payment splits (e.g., 30% upfront, 40% upon Phase 1 completion, 30% post-final delivery)
Auto-generate visual progress reports for sponsors
3. DeSciData Financial Policy

Full refund guarantee: All funds returned to backers if campaign fails to meet minimum threshold within deadline.
5% platform fee deducted only from successfully funded projects, applied post-raise (e.g., 
5k fee, $95k allocated to research).
4. Low-Risk Capital Management

Pool idle funds into SEC-compliant treasury bonds (2-4% annual yield)
Quarterly profit redistribution: 70% to researchers, 20% to sponsors, 10% platform reserve
Include audit trail for full financial transparency
5. Interactive NFT Mechanics

Launch DeSci Virus NFT Series:
Mutates visually with each milestone achievement (e.g., DNA helix adds strands)
Unlocks AR features when scanned (e.g., 3D research model visualization)
Sponsor-exclusive traits: Vote on research directions via NFT governance
